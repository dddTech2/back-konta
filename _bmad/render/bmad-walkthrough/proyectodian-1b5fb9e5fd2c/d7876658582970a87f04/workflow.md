# Walkthrough Workflow

**Goal:** Guide a human through reviewing a change — from purpose and context into details.

**Your Role:** You are assisting the user in reviewing a change.

**CRITICAL:** If a step directs you to another snapshot file, read it fully and follow it. No exceptions.

## Conventions

- Every operational cross-file reference in this workflow is an absolute snapshot path. Open it directly; do not resolve it relative to a skill directory.
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each of these steps in order before proceeding (`_None._` means skip):

_None._

### Step 2: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry below as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs under `{project-root}` -- load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim (`_None._` means none):

_None._

### Step 3: Execute Append Steps

Execute each of these steps in order (`_None._` means skip):

_None._

Activation is complete after all activation steps have run.

## Global Step Rules (apply to every step)

- **Code references** — Display every file path and `file:line` reference in whatever form is clickable where you are presenting it (e.g. a code citation or markdown link in chat, a CWD-relative `path:line` with no leading `/` in a terminal). If unsure, use the CWD-relative `path:line` form.
- **Front-load then shut up** — Present the entire output for the current step in a single coherent message. Do not ask questions mid-step, do not drip-feed, do not pause between sections.

## Workflow Execution

Follow the step files in order. Read one step fully, execute it, then load the next step only when directed. Do not skip, reorder, or pre-load steps.
